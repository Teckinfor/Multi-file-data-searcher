# Multi-file-data-searcher
Script used to search for a character string on several lists in the form of files. 
Kind of like CTRL+F on multiple files.\
(files in .txt)

# How it works ?
You have just to put your files on folder "database".\
Then run the script, enter your search, wait some minutes and... TADA !\
The script runs alone.
